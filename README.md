# vibe-devops

An open-source AI terminal agent for automated DevOps tasks.

## Features

- **Natural Language to Shell**: Convert plain English requests into executable shell commands.
- **AI-Powered**: Uses providers like Gemini to generate commands.
- **Safety First**: Shows every command for confirmation before execution.
- **Extensible**: Pluggable AI provider architecture.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Installation

### One-Line Install (Linux & macOS)

You can install `vibe` with a single command. This will download the latest release and place it in `/usr/local/bin`.

**Prerequisites**: `curl` must be installed.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phamdaiminhquan/vibe-devops/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Build from Source

If you prefer, you can build from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/phamdaiminhquan/vibe-devops.git
cd vibe-devops

# Build the binary
go build -o vibe
```

## Usage

### 1. Initialize Vibe

First, navigate to your project directory and run `vibe init`. This will create a `.vibe.yaml` file.

```bash
# Initialize in the current directory
vibe init .
```

### 2. Configure Your API Key

Use the `config` command to select a provider and set your Gemini API key.

```bash
# Select provider
vibe config provider gemini

# Set API key (will validate and prompt you to choose a model)
vibe config api-key "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

### 3. Run Commands

Now you can make requests in natural language. Vibe will generate a shell command, ask for your confirmation, and then execute it.

```bash
vibe run "list all running docker containers"
```

If you want Vibe to gather a bit of workspace context (read-only) before proposing a command, enable agent mode:

```bash
vibe run --agent "explain this repo structure and suggest the right go test command"
```

For troubleshooting-style questions, you can enable a self-heal loop so Vibe can read command output and continue iterating until it can explain the root cause:

```bash
vibe run --agent --self-heal "explain why service X is not running"
```

**Example Interaction:**

```
$ vibe run "show me the last 5 git commits with their author"

🤖 Calling AI to generate command...
ℹ️  Note: Currently, Vibe only interprets the command you send without any additional context.

Vibe suggests the following command:

git log -5 --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
